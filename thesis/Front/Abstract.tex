\chapter{Abstract}

Append only sets are sets that only allow insertions at the end end of the data space, and where existing data can not be changed retrospectively. This type of set can be found in many areas of computer networking, for example in some types of social media or in games like chess. In an infrastructure less environment, such as peer-to-peer networks, the set synchronization can cause a performance overhead. This project aims to develop a general history aware set synchronization protocol for infrastructure less environments, furthermore it will implement the theoretical work in a secure way as an android app, to evaluate the use of the designed protocol.
