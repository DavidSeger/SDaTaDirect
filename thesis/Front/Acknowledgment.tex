\chapter{Acknowledgments}
I would like to thank Professor Doctor Tschudin for the chance to work on this project, as it gave me great insight into the world of alternative network architectures, and for the experience gained in the practical side of network programming. I also thank Gowthaman Gobalasingam for the previous work put into the app which provides the basis of the implementation presented in this report, as well as the help he provided to gain an overview of the existing code. Most of all i thank my supervisor Claudio Marxer for the guidance and the help he has given me through this work.
