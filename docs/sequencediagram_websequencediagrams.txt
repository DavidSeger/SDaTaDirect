title History Aware Set Synchronization Protocol

note right of Bob: Every participant in the p2p network has a database containting \n meta-data about the communication, mainly timestamps of \n the last snychronization with any given peer, the last known \n transmitted message for every feed/peer pair and infos about \n which peer is subscribed to which feed or peer
note right of Bob: Phase 1: Exchange news about subscribtions, \n unsubscriptions and newly discovered feeds or pubs
loop repeat for both participants as update sender and receiver
Bob->+Alice: Send all changes in feeds or feed subscriptions \n since last meeting with Alice
Alice -->-Bob: Request the full feed if it is unknown to Alice
Bob -->-Alice: Answer the feed requests
Bob ->Alice: end phase 1
end

note right of Bob: Phase 2: Exchange the newest available message \n sequence number for every interesting feed or pub

loop repeat for both participants as update sender and receiver
Bob->Alice: Send the sequence number of the newest \n available message in every relevant feed, \n given there are new messages since the last sync
Bob ->Alice: end phase 2
end

note right of Bob: Phase 3: Exchange relevent new content of the feeds

loop repeat for both participants as update sender and receiver
Bob->+Alice: Request a range of messages posted in the relevant \n feeds, given there are messages Alice has not received yet
Alice ->-Bob: Answer the message requests with the corresponding \n messages
Bob -->Alice: Given Bob is a Pub hoster that Alice is subscribed \n to, update Alice about the successfully published pub content
Bob -> Alice: End Phase 3
end

note right of Bob: Phase 4: synchronize the last synchronization timestamp across \n both synchronization participants
Bob -> Alice: Send the last synchronization timestamp
